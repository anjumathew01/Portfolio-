                    <p> I've lived in Oregon my entire life. I went to school in Portland up until college and then moved to Corvallis to attend Oregon State University. Go beavs! I'm majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Business so I am pretty busy most of the time with school, but I'm able to stay involved in many of my favorite activities.
                        I've played tennis the entirety of my life and am part of the club team here at OSU. I used to be one of the officers that helped run the club and facitiliate practice up unit recently. I'm also part of the Indian Student Association which is a club that puts on cultural events, usually a couple times a term. On top of those two things, 
                        I work two part time jobs. I'm an intern for 4g clinical, a Portland based company specializing in randomization and trial and supply management. I interned with them last summer and really enjoyed my work so I have been continuing to work part time throughout the school year. I'm also an Undergraduate Learning Assistant for intro to 
                        Usability at OSU. I took the class my Sophomore year and was very interested in the topics covered and have been a ULA ever since.

                        Among some of the things I love are hiking, reading, and huskies. Living in the PNW I find it impossible to not love hiking since there are so many beautiful trails everywhere. I try to go on one hike every two weeks once it hits summer time. As for reading, I used to be much more into it, but I do feel once I hit college the time I had to allot
                        to it became much less. As for huskies, I just love them.
